# CS230-Design-Document

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    The Gaming Room is the creator of the mobile game Draw It or Lose It, a game based off of the 1980s tv show Win, Lose, or Draw.  They want to port
    their game to a web-based application.  They have the following requirements from the design document:
        ●	One or more teams able to join a game
        ●	Multiple players assigned to each team
        ●	Game and team names must be unique
        ●	Users must be able to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name
        ●	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.
          ○	This will be accomplished by unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    During the course of developing this documentation I feel that the things that I did particularly well are researching the different available
    choices for creating the web based application and interpreting the UML diagram.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    The item I found most helpful when developing the code was the UML diagram. The UML Diagram allowed me to verify the different functions,
    setters, getters, and variables needed to meet the client's requirements.  The UML diagram also informed me of whether the different items
    were public or private, as well as if they were a subclass or not.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    If I were to choose one part of my work on this document to revise, I would revise the recommendations section.  In my revision I would be
    more thorough on my supporting information.  I would also recommend, if working as part of a team, on receiving assistance from a team member
    more experienced in the field of web based applications, the Cloud and Linux servers.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because those needs are what set the basis for completion criteria for the project, as well
    as any testing scenarios that should be considered.  In order to interpret The Gaming Room's needs I read the initial project request stating
    their requirements.  To implement those needs a UML diagram was created to help identify the various classes needed, their attributes, and relations.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    
    In designing software I approach the process working backwards from the requirements set forth. From the requirements I can build a list of what needs
    to be done to meet those requirements and then work on the items needed to complete that list.
